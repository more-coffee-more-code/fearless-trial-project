# Purple Cow Project
### This web app now only allows the user to click on a button that displays the number of total hits the Counter API (https://countapi.xyz/) has received, but it also keeps track of the number of times the user has clicked on the button. The app was built using Vue.js, HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, and BEM.

## Here is a simple flow chart to demonstrate how it works
